Embed-API
=========

The general idea consists of two parts: the SDK javascript code, which has to
be loaded once, and widget markers in the DOM. On initialization, the widget
markers are replaced by iframes, which show the actual content.


SDK snippet
-----------

- Bootstraps everything, initializes widgets
- Select Adhocracy version to be used
- Opens `adhocracy` namespace
- Resizes widgets on the fly

Example::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://adhocracy.lan/static/js/AdhocracySDK.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        adhocracy.init('http://adhocracy.lan', function(adhocracy) {
            adhocracy.embed('.adhocracy_marker');
        });
    </script>

One or more markers can appear anywhere in the document::

    <div class="adhocracy_marker"
         data-widget="document-workbench">
    </div>
    <div class="adhocracy_marker"
         data-widget="paragraph-version-detail"
         data-locale="en"
         data-ref="..." data-viewmode="display">
    </div>

Widget markers
--------------

A widget is defined by

- One angular directive (presentation)
- Optionally a locale
- Multiple directive parameters, e.g.

  - One or multiple resources (content)
  - Initial widget state? (e.g. initial list sorting)
  - Other widget parameters? (e.g. specify subwidgets)


Constraints:

- Different HTML5 (`data`- parameters) and HTML4 syntax (different)


Example (current HTML5 syntax)::

    <div id="adhocracy_marker" data-widget="proposal-workbench" data-content="/proposal"></div>

Embed Widget for testing
------------------------

In order to develop and test functionalities of frontend widgets in an isolated way there is the possibility to display a widget as if it was embeded. For that, the module to which the widget (e.g. the angular directive) belongs has to inject the Embed-Package.

Example::

    import AdhEmbed = require("../Embed/Embed");

    export var myDirective = () => {
        // your directive's code
    };

    export var moduleName = "adhMyModule";

    export var register = (angular) => {
    angular
        .module(moduleName, [AdhEmbed.moduleName])
        .config(["adhEmbedProvider", (adhEmbedProvider : AdhEmbed.Provider) => {
            adhEmbedProvider.registerEmbeddableDirectives(["my-directive"]);
        }])
        .directive("adhMyDirective", [myDirective])
    };

Now you can see your widget under::

    /embed/my-directive

Maybe you would also like to add data to your directive using attributes. As there is no surrounding scope to your directive, this needs to be mocked. You can do that by appending some get parameters to your url.

For example like this::

    /embed/my-directive?variable1=1&variable2=2

The html-element, that is added to the embed page will look like this::

    <adh-my-directive data-variable1="1" data-variable2="2" ></adh-my-directive

In your directive you can now for example use this like this::

    export var myDirective = () => {
        return {
            scope: {
                variable1: "=",
                variable2: "=",
            },
        // more code
    };
