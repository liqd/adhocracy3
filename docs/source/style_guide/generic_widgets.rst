Adhocracy Generic Widgets
=========================


Introduction
------------

In the context of the adhocracy software project, a *widget* is an
element of the UI. In the JavaScript frontend, this is implemented
as a class for creating angular directives.  Widgets are called
*generic* because the set of content types and UI contexts they can
be used with can be configured quite flexibly.

This document outlines implementation and usage of widgets.  It
assumes some familiarity with angularjs and typescript.


Adapters Classes
----------------

An adapter class provides a uniform interface to resources of
different content types that share some structure (in the most common
case, property sheets).  It can be considered the *glue* between
widgets and resources.

Example::

    export interface IListingContainerAdapter {
        elemRefs(any) : string[] {
    }

    export class ListingPoolAdapter implements IListingContainerAdapter {
        public elemRefs(container : Types.Content<Resources.HasIPoolSheet>) {
            return container.data["adhocracy.sheets.pool.IPool"].elements;
        }
    }

The adapter provides a method ``elemRefs`` that consumes a container
resource of a given content type, and returns a list of paths to more
resources, namely the elements in the container.

The example implementation requires the container to have the ``Pool``
sheet and gets the element paths from there.


Widget Classes
--------------

A simple widget class has the following form::

    export class WidgetName<...Types> {
        public static ...

        constructor(...adapters, ...parameters) {
            ...
        }

        public createDirective(...services) {
            return {
                restrict: ...
                templateUrl: ...
                scope: ...
            };
        }
    }

A directive ``<adh-listing>`` based on a widget ``Listing`` can then be
registered like so::

    app.directive("adhListing", [
        "$q", "adhHttp",
        ($q, adhHttp) => new Listing(new ListingAdapter($q)).createDirective(adhHttp)
    ]);

There are some interesting parts to note in this example:

-   The type variables to ``Listing`` are inferred.
-   Some services are passed to adapters, while others are passed to
    ``createDirective``. The whole thing is wrapped in a lambda to
    accomplish this.
-   By convention, all services required by ``Listing`` are passed to
    ``createDirective``.
-   By convention, all adapters and additional parameters are passed
    to the constructor.
-   It would be possible to use a single function and pass both adapters and
    services to that. But that would not allow subclassing.
-   It would be possible to have a single static method on the widget class
    and pass both adapters and services to that. But that would not allow
    a strict separation of the two.

There are several ways in which behavior of existing widgets can be
changed to adapt to new requirements.


Static class attributes and extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example::

    export class SomeWidget {
        public static templateUrl : string = "/Widgets/Listing.html";

        ...

        public createDirective() {
            var _self = this;
            var _class = (<any>_self).constructor;

            return {
                templateUrl: _class.templateUrl;
                ...

Directives constructed from ``SomeWidget`` will always use the same
template, no matter where used.  If you want to change the template,
write the following trivial extension class::

    export class SomeWidgetForSomeFancyClient extends SomeWidget {
        public static templateUrl : string = "/Widgets/FancyListing.html";
    }


Constructor Params
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to decide on behavior every time you register a directive,
you can add constructor parameters::

    export class SomeWidget {
        constructor(public title : string) {
            return;
        }

        public createDirective() {
            var _self = this;
            var _class = (<any>_self).constructor;

            return {
                controller: ($scope) => {
                    $scope.title = _self.title;
                    ...


Transclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use angular's `transclusion
<https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements>`_
feature to pass a template snippet to the widget::

    <adh-listing path="/adhocracy/Proposals">
        <adh-element path="{{element}}"></adh-element>
    </adh-listing>

.. note::

   The ``inject`` directive allows passing multiple elements via
   transclusion.

[FIXME: document scope propagation; see FIXME near class
Widget.Listing.  i think in order to get this done, we need to write
our own transclude function and inject it to the directive's link
attribute.]


Misc Ideas and Remarks
----------------------


Heterogeneous Listings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we wanted to specify search results that contain a range of
heterogeneous objects, writing the adapter is slightly more
challenging: On the one hand, we may want to do something specific
where possible, such as allowing for inline-comments::

    export class ListingElementWithCommentsAdapter implements ... {
        public renderCommentButton: ... = ...
        ...
    }

On the other, we want do not want to insist that it is possible for
all elements.

The solution is to resort to dynamic checks::

    export class ArbitraryListingElementAdapter implements ... {
        public renderItAll(...) {
            ...
            if ('comments' in self) {
                ...
            } else {
                ...  // (do some padding where the comment button is missing)
            }
            if ('votes' in self) {
                ...
            }
            ...

So the idea of statically typed adapter hierarchies works, but can be
extended to dynamically typed ones that are arbitrarily flexible.
When maintaining and developing adhocracy, you can always pick the
adapter closest to what you need, and you will get less code that is
more robust and easier to read.
